your reviews were fine (though there are always many suggestions that could be given on any plot, i find it hard that you could not think of anything to improve ndsouza's plot! see below)
10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

axis labels and especially tick labels are far far faaaaar too small to be readable. same for legend. the title is readable, and all labels should be that size

there is a lot of empty space. remember tufte's rules. a compressed y axis would actually help the intuition allowing to see the entire plot at once instead of bouncing between points with the gaze

the colors are nicely colorblind compliant and the dashed vs solid line also helps separating the data in b&w


NOTES ON  THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


myphan92
============

the choice of plotting data instead of a histogram is esthetically appealing but largely compromises readability and causes ambiguity

the datapoints hide a pattern in the data: the age increases more significantly for women, peaking around 1980, but it is hard to tell.

the green foreground datapoints hide the background blue datapoints -> confusion and ambiguity. 

color are compliant with most color blind prescriptions

the datapoints without transparency or edges blend at the bottom. it is not a crucial problem since this plot is not meant to be read point by point however.


tick labels too small

title to verbose: that level of description belongs to the caption. title should be succinct


neilverosh
============

colors are nicely vivid and color blind compliant

axis labels too small

the plot is largely empty (remember tufte's rules!) a shorter more compact y axis would help comparison



yunongcao
============

the color is not explained

units re missing on the x and y labels (seconds?)

the units on the tick labels should be compressed 

the plot is very informative (one of the best seaborn visualizations) but poorly documented
