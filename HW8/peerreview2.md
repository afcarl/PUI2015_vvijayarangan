Neil:

Clarity:
The plot is very easy to read and understand.

Esthetic:
Colours chosen are colourblind compliant, the decision not to include a grid is good as it may have been distracting.

Honesty:
The plot is honest and isnâ€™t distorting the data.

Suggestions:
The plot meets its goals, no suggestions to improve it.
