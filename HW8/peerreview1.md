My Phan:

### Clarity:
The plot is simple to read and understand. However, there are some visible outliers in the birth year that could have been removed.

### Aesthetic:
The choice of colours is pleasing to the eye, however is hard to distinguish by colourblind people.

### Honesty:
The plot is honest, however since a lot of data is clustered together, it is not easy to interpret the data.

### Suggestion:
A log-log plot of both variables should make an interesting plot.
