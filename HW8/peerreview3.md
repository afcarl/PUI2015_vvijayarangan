### Clarity:
I found the plots very hard to understand. There were no titles for both plots and from the axis labels it wasn’t clear what the plots were about. I was also not able to understand the units easily. A little research revealed that these plots were hexagonal binning plots similar to scatter plots however it was unclear why the two variables were being compared.

### Aesthetic:
Given that the colour scheme used was monochromatic it was colorblind compliant.

### Honesty:
The plot is difficult to read so I cannot comment on it’s honesty. However, it appears that there is too much information on the plot.

### Suggestions:
A Title and better labels would have helped. A description also. However, the method of hexagonal binning as such was very interesting and I learnt quite a lot.
