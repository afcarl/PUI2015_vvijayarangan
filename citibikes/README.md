We downloaded the Citibike data for october of 2014. Please notice that this file needs to be downloaded for running the ipython notebook since it cannot be uploaded to Github for its size. The link for the download is https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.
We sat down to do the job together so the distribution of tasks is very even.
